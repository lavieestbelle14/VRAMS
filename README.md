## Our Logo

The eRehistroPH logo is more than just a seal — it’s a symbol of civic duty, empowerment, and digital innovation in public service.

**The Ballot Box with the Check Mark** — At the heart of the logo is a stylized ballot box marked with a golden check. It represents every vote cast — a voice heard, a choice made. It’s the centerpiece of democracy, where every tick matters.

**The Radiating Lines** — These golden rays behind the ballot box symbolize enlightenment and hope — that with every new voter registration, we bring light to the nation’s future. It’s a reminder that progress begins with participation.

**The Bold Blue and Gold Colors** — Blue stands for integrity, trust, and the backbone of the system — the people. Gold reflects the value of your right to vote, something to be guarded, respected, and exercised with pride.

**The Circular Text** — Surrounding the image, the name "Voter Registration and Application Management System (VRAMS)" wraps around like a shield — signifying security, accessibility, and streamlined service for every eligible Filipino.
